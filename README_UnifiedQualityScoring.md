# STUDENT ANALYST - Unified Quality Scoring System
## Task B1.3.4 - Quality Score Calculation

### üéØ System Overview

The **Unified Quality Scoring System** is the culmination of our comprehensive data quality assurance pipeline. It combines all previous quality checks (Missing Data Detection, Outlier Detection, and Data Consistency Validation) into a single, easy-to-understand score from 0-100.

Think of it as a "report card" for your financial data - just like a school grade, it immediately tells you whether your data is ready for important investment decisions.

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

#### Core Components

1. **Quality Score Calculator**
   - Combines results from all three quality systems
   - Applies weighted scoring based on severity and impact
   - Generates confidence metrics and reliability assessments

2. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - Visual representation of quality scores with color-coded indicators
   - Component breakdown showing individual system contributions
   - Real-time alerts and actionable recommendations

3. **Scenario Testing System**
   - 5 predefined test scenarios from excellent to unacceptable quality
   - Mock data generation for demonstration purposes
   - Performance metrics tracking

#### Scoring Algorithm

```mathematical
Overall Score = (Missing Data Score √ó 30%) + (Outlier Score √ó 20%) + (Consistency Score √ó 50%)

Where:
- Missing Data Weight: 30% (important but often correctable)
- Outlier Weight: 20% (may represent real market events)
- Consistency Weight: 50% (critical for calculation accuracy)
```

#### Quality Grades

| Score Range | Grade | Color | Reliability | Recommendation |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 95-100 | A+ | Green | Excellent | Ready for all analyses |
| 90-94 | A | Green | Excellent | Ready for all analyses |
| 85-89 | B+ | Yellow | Good | Minor monitoring needed |
| 80-84 | B | Yellow | Good | Minor monitoring needed |
| 75-79 | C+ | Yellow | Good | Some attention required |
| 70-74 | C | Yellow | Good | Some attention required |
| 60-69 | D | Orange | Fair | Improvements needed |
| 0-59 | F | Red | Poor/Unacceptable | Do not use for decisions |
